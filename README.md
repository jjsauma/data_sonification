# Sonifying the news

Data sonification is a recent trend in the fields of data analysis and data science. This technique takes advantage of the fact that humans perceive sound differently than visual information. For example, it is proven that we are more sensitive to changes in tone or volume than to changes in colour, so we can differentiate between very subtle changes in the information if it is presented as sound or music. Complementing images with sound in data analysis will allow us to better understand our information.

In a sonification, the data is translated into values, and these numbers, in turn, are translated into scales, tones, volume, rhythm and other parameters they have can be interpreted as music or sound.

The experience of sonifying information over time makes this representation of data a dynamic experience since we can find details that we could not perceive in a graph or visualization.

In this experiment, we will sonify the pageviews that were presented during 2019 on showbiz magazine quien.com. With this representation, we can hear the balance between the sections, the relationships they had with each other, their relationship with events that happened during that year and their own dynamics.

To make this video, we took the daily information of the sections that have the highest number of visits: Showbiz, Royalty, Social Circles, Beauty, Fashion and Politics. We use the 365 days of a year, we visit one by one and use the percentage of the pageviews of each day control a parameter of instruments playing music in the way of a conductor. The assignment of the instruments is related to the presence in the composition, making an analogy with the presence of each section. For example, the Showbiz section is the most visited, and the drums are the predominant instrument in this composition, so the information on pageviews will control the performance of the drums.

This technique is being used to explore demographic, sociological, environmental, health, and even natural phenomena. Although the resulting sonifications cannot be considered works of art or the next worldwide musical hit, they allow us to perceive the data from other points of view.

More sonification and research coming soon.
